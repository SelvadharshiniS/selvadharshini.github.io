    <h2>3D DESIGN</h2>
    <p>
         3D design refers to using software to create a digital model of a three-dimensional shape or object.
         Organizations and professionals across industries use 3D design to communicate ideas, create products and customer experiences, 
         teach concepts, and more.
         For example, dentists can X-ray a damaged tooth and produce a 3D model of a crown to repair it,
         while the film industry uses 3D design to envision scenes and execute special effects. </p>

    <h2>TYPES OF 3D DESIGN</h2>
         
         <ol>
            <li>Solid</li>
            <li>Wireframe</li>
            <li>Surface</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>SOLID</h3>
         <p>Solid modelling involves working with pre-defined shapes, such as cubes, cylinders, spheres and other polyhedrons, to add features or cut material away.
             It is typically used in mechanical and construction based applications, where specific parameters, measurements and shapes are more defined.</p>

         <h3>WIREFRAME</h3>
         <p> The 3D wireframe model is the abstract form of a 3D CAD model other two forms are surface modeling and solid modeling.
             These three modeling techniques when combined make up a well-defined realistic object model to demonstrate your concepts in real-time.
              A wireframe model is created by roughly defining every edge and corner of the material object.

        <h3>SURFACE</h3>
        <p >Surface models are created by connecting various surface elements to represent part geometry.
             A surface model can be built from a wire frame model by defining the surfaces. 
             They hold the description of an object in terms of points, edges and faces between the edges. </p>

                  <h2>SOLID</h2>
                  <p>Solid modeling works with three-dimensional shapes.
                     The shapes may vary, but they act together like building blocks.</p>

                  <h2>WIRE FRAME</h2>
                  <p>Wireframe modeling can help in cases where the surface is complex and curved. 
                    Eventually, youâ€™ll find that the basic building blocks of solid modeling are too obtuse for some applications, 
                    and wireframe modeling provides the finesse for more complex forms.</p>

                  <h2>SURFACE</h2>
                  <p>Surface modeling is the next step up in complexity.
                     Highly professional applications demand smooth surfaces and seamless integration, 
                     and this can be handled by more advanced programs that require more work and computing power. </p>
